## STAT206-Final-Project Due: 12/13/2024

## Summary

Based on features of houses in Ames,IA including neighborhood, lot size
and around 80 other features, we aim to model the final sale price of
those houses. Using pre-processing analysis with Q-Q plots and t tests,
we can better prepare the data to produce a more accurate model. In our
analysis, we reached a 75% correlation between our training data and the
actual sale price.

### Required Packages
